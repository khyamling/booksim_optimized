BookSim Interconnection Network Simulator
=========================================

BookSim is a cycle-accurate interconnection network simulator.
Originally developed for and introduced with the [Principles and Practices of Interconnection Networks](http://cva.stanford.edu/books/ppin/) book, its functionality has since been continuously extended.  To speedup the simulations, it is necessary to investigate and optimize the hotspots in the simulator source code. The Booksim2.0 is used for the analysis of cache and memory system behavior. The OpenMP programming model and SIMD are used for parallelizing and vectorizingthe more time consuming portions of Booksim2.0. We optimized the booksim source code to accelerate the simulation speed.
